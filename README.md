# LPRNet_Optimzation_Project
In this project, we explore multiple optimization techniques to optimize the LPRNet Pytorch model, to efficiently recognize vehicle plates.

Model Compression:

1) Fine grained pruning
2) Static Quantization

Model Compilation

1) Graph Optimization
2) Multiple compiler optimization using TVM Auto-Scheduler

Please find attached the link to Google Colab Notebook to run the scripts for different model variants:
